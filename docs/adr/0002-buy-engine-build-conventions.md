# ADR 0002 — Buy the orchestration engine (Composio); build only the conventions/policy

**Status:** accepted

## Context
The orchestration plumbing — isolating worktrees, running agents, opening PRs — is commoditised and
more mature off-the-shelf than anything we would maintain. Our differentiator is the
**policy/conventions**, not a from-scratch runner. Operating constraint: the operator drives monthly
**subscriptions, not API keys**; vendor terms permit driving the **official CLIs** headlessly under
subscription (rate-limited) but prohibit extracting OAuth tokens into a custom client.

## Decision
- **Engine = Composio (`@aoagents/ao`)** — it drives the official Claude / Codex / Cursor CLIs on
  subscription auth, isolates each worker in its own worktree, and opens PRs. **Never token
  extraction.**
- This pack ships only the **conventions, planning (grill-me), task template, and ADRs** — the
  operating manual and scaffolder that sit on top of the engine.
- **Merge vehicle = a PR**, never `git push HEAD:main`. CI re-runs the gate in the canonical
  environment; **the PR is both the merge vehicle and the human handoff**.

## Consequences
- One mature engine, maintained by someone else; we maintain policy.
- Composio is fleet-first, so **competitive best-of-N is manual** (same task, agent overridden;
  a human picks/merges) — acceptable, since best-of-N is the ~10% case (ADR-0004).
- Cursor CLI is beta = the flakiest worker; the engine degrades gracefully if a worker errors.
- If Composio is ever swapped out, the backbone (ADR-0001) and these conventions are unaffected.
